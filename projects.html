                Moon Valley is an RPG game in where we accompany a lost walrus in his search for his real identity. 
                Along the way we meet different characters throughout each biome who aid the cat in collecting items for the walrus to figure out who he real is.

                    QuBetterParking is a simulator designed for the Quinnipiac University Campus parking since there are multiple issues surrounding it. 
                    In this simulator each student/faculty member gets assigned a parking ticket which tells them where exactly they should be parking.
                    As each person enters the parking lot an updated view of available spots is shown. 
                    When the lot is full the simulator informs the user that the lot is full. 
                    Finally, when students/faculty members are exiting the lot, they return their tickets showing that spots are becoming available.
